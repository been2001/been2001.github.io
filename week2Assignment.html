// In this assignment, you will need to work through each of the steps and figure out what the value of the variable equals each 
// step of the way. Once you have worked out what the value is at each step, send an email to your instructor letting us
// know what you think the answers are.
 
//variable created:
var x = 3;
 
//step 1, what does x after the changes in the code below?
x = x + x
 =6

//step 2, what does x after the changes in the code below?
for(var i = 0; i < 4; i++){
    x = x + 1
x=x+4=10

-1 i mean it depends i++ which could be 2.
}
 
//step 3, what does x after the changes in the code below?
if(x > 10){
    x = 2;
} else {
    x = 3;
=3

}
 
//step 4, what does x after the changes in the code below?
function doubleIt(value){
    return value*2;


}
 /
doubleIt(x);
x = doubleIt(x);

x=3

3*2=6

 
//step 5, what does x after the changes in the code below?
var numberArray = [1,2,3];
 
for(i = 0; i < numberArray.length; i++){
    x = x + numberArray[I];

x=9

}
