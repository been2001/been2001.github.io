<p> Feeling good with Abukar and Murshad on New Year day!</br>
Murshad talked about the beauty of the day 
 <p>
<p> Abukar talked about what happen last night on Mariah Carey was bad Sync microphone and unacceptable </br> and here is the link 
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/01/arts/music/mariah-carey-new-years-eve-times-square.html?_r=0">google</a>. </br>Murshad said she was one of my best performers, really felt bad and pointed out some of her best looking pictures.</br>
He also said, this was a big mistake by the technical team and they should be accountable. However, here is my favorite picture</br>.
